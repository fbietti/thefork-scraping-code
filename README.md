# the fork scraping code

This project arose from the need to find new topics for my data analysis assignments at the university. The idea was to identify data online, structure it into a dataset, then conduct analyses and engage the students in practical exercises!

In this project, you will find a file for web scraping data from The Fork website. It is a Python code and is well-commented. It does not require prior knowledge of HTML or CSS. You just need to know how to identify the element you are interested in on the site and copy the corresponding code into the for loop.
